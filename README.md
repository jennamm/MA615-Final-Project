# MA615-Final-Project

## Background

I have been working with a team on a project with the Noise Lab with Erica Walker and with data from the Analyze Boston website. Here, we joined the two datasets to make one large dataset with data from both sources. Now, we mapped the data to show different demographic social vulnerabilities with the Noise Lab measurements.

## This Project

As a continuation of this Noise Lab project, I want to answer these two statements:

-	Look at the Noise Lab data, specifically the sources column, and research the average distance that sound travels for each item (i.e. fireworks).
-	Produce a map with rings/circles around those points where the noise should end.


The purpose of me doing this analysis is for further EDA on the client's research but this could also even help people choose where to live.
